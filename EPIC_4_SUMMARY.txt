Epic 4 Implementation Summary:
1.  **HI 4.1**: Verified audit logging in `AppContext.tsx`. Added logs for USER_CREATED, USER_UPDATED, TENANT_CREATED, TENANT_UPDATED, TENANT_DELETED, LOGIN_SUCCESS, LOGIN_FAILED, IMPERSONATION_STARTED.
2.  **HI 4.2**: Created `app/dashboard/admin/audit/page.tsx` which lists audit events from `DB.platformAudit`.
3.  **HI 4.3**: Added filters in `AuditPage` for Text Search, Tenant, Event Type, and Date Range.
4.  **HI 4.4**: Implemented CSV Export in `AuditPage`, generating a CSV Blob and triggering download, while also logging the export action itself.

Verification:
-   **Structure**: `DB.platformAudit` is the central store.
-   **Logging**: `AppContext` pushes to this array securely.
-   **UI**: `AuditPage` renders this array with filters and pagination.
-   **Export**: Validated logic for CSV generation.

Ready for user review.
